Transitioning from EV3-G
========================

The **micropython-ev3dev** library is designed to look and feel very similar
to the blocks in the official EV3 programming software from LEGO.

This guide is intended to help you translate a program from EV3-G to MicroPython
using the **micropython-ev3dev** library.

.. tip:: Keep in mind that this guide is not meant to be an example of how you
    should write programs in general. It is just a way to do a direct
    translation from EV3-G using the patterns of the EV3-G software, which
    are not necessarily useful patterns to copy in other programming languages.
